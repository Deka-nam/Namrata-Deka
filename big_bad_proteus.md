# Why *Proteus mirabilis* Deserves Your Attention  

Date: 2025-07-16

While *E. coli* dominates urinary tract infection research, *Proteus mirabilis* is a clinically understudied pathogen with remarkable adaptations:  
- **Stone-forming architect**: A leading cause of catheter-associated complications due to urease-driven mineralization.  
- **Swarming motility**: Rapid surface migration that complicates biofilm eradication.  
- **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) plasticity**: Shifts genotypes/phenotypes under therapeutic pressure, making it a priority AMR surveillance target.  

My PhD integrates wet-lab experiments and computational genomics to decode *P. mirabilis* evolution—because impactful bioinformatics starts with biological questions.

## The Urgent Questions Driving Our Work

### 1. Urease: A Molecular Saboteur
*P. mirabilis* produces urease, an enzyme that alkalinizes urine and triggers struvite crystal formation. These crystals are far from benign, they:

- Grow into kidney stones, complicating patient outcomes.
- Obstruct catheters, increasing hospitalization risks.
- Shield bacteria in biofilms, rendering antibiotics ineffective.
- Under antibiotic pressure, *P. mirabilis* rapidly evolves resistance. Yet its mechanisms remain understudied compared to pathogens like *E. coli*.
- By dissecting its evolution (wet lab + computational genomics), we aim to uncover targets for better diagnostics and therapies.

### 2. Antibiotic Resistance: A Growing Arsenal
P. mirabilis exhibits both intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms, including:

- Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)
- Multidrug efflux pumps
- Horizontal gene transfer of resistance plasmids

Our pan-genome analyses reveal core versus accessory genetic elements that may drive clinical treatment failures.

### 3. Rapid Evolution Under Host Pressure

We are analyzing longitudinal *P. mirabilis* isolates from the same patient to uncover:

- Adaptive mechanisms under host selection pressures.
- Mutation rates during chronic colonization.
- Emerging resistance patterns in the urinary tract environment.

## Translational Impact

This work extends beyond basic science:

- **Clinical Practice**: Guides catheter management and relapse prevention.
- **Biotech Innovation**: Informs diagnostic tools and antimicrobial coatings.
- **Evolutionary Insight**: Serves as a model for bacterial persistence and plasticity.

## Research Vision

We aim to construct a predictive genomic framework for *P. mirabilis* by integrating:

- Longitudinal genomic trajectories
- Antibiotic exposure histories
- Clinically relevant genotype-phenotype correlations

**Ultimate Goal**: Shift from reactive treatment to proactive prediction of bacterial behavior.

##  TL;DR

We're reverse-engineering a pathogen's playbook.

Through *Proteus mirabilis*, we're decoding:

- Stone-driven **infection strategies**
- Real-time **resistance evolution**
- **Host-pathogen arms races** in the urinary tract
